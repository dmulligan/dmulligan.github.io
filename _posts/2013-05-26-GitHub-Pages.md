This is my first test of [GitHub](http://www.github.com) Pages and [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages). I'm going to have to get a hang of this social coding sooner or later. Getting a grip of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) appears to be the first challenge.
